## Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints whether a random number is positive or negative.

**Description:** 
The program assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

## Task 1: The last digit

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints the last digit of a random number.

**Description:** 
The program assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints the last digit of that number.

## Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet.

**Description:** 
The program uses the `putchar` function to print each lowercase letter of the alphabet in a loop.

## Task 3: alphABET

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabet.

**Description:** 
The program uses the `putchar` function to print each lowercase and uppercase letter of the alphabet in a loop.

## Task 4: Hexadecimal printing

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 and the corresponding hexadecimal value.

**Description:** 
The program uses a loop to iterate through the numbers 0 to 9 and prints each number and its corresponding hexadecimal value.

## Task 5: I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints every minute of a day.

**Description:** 
The program uses nested loops to simulate the passing of time, printing every minute of a day in the format "HH:MM".

## Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints a pyramid pattern.

**Description:** 
The program uses loops to print a pyramid pattern using asterisks (`*`) and spaces.

## Task 7: islower

**Objective:** 
Write a program that checks if a character is lowercase.

**Description:** 
The program prompts the user to enter a character and checks if it is a lowercase letter.

## Task 8: 00...99

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints all two-digit numbers.

**Description:** 
The program uses loops to print all two-digit numbers from 00 to 99.

## Task 9: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important

**Objective:** 
Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two digits.

**Description:** 
The program uses loops to print all possible combinations of two digits from 00 to 99.

## Task 10: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

**Advanced**

**Objective:**
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

**Description:**
- Numbers must be separated by `, `, followed by a space
- The two digits must be different
- `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function like `printf`, `puts`, etc... is forbidden)
- You can only use `putchar` five times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
- All your code should be in the `main` function

## Task 11: Combination of Three Digits

**Advanced**

**Objective:**
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

**Description:**
- Print all combinations of three digits, separated by `, ` and followed by a space.
- The three digits must be different.
- Combinations such as `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201`, `210` are considered the same combination of the digits `0`, `1`, and `2`.
- Print only the smallest combination of three digits.
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order with three digits.
- You can only use the `putchar` function (other functions like `printf`, `puts` are forbidden).
- Limit the usage of `putchar` to a maximum of six times in your code.
- Avoid using variables of type `char`.
- All code should be in the `main` function.

## Task 12: Combinations of Two Two-Digit Numbers

**Advanced**

**Objective:**
Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

**Description:**
- Print all combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by a space.
- The numbers should range from 0 to 99.
- All numbers should be printed with two digits. For example, 1 should be printed as 01.
- The combinations of numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space.
- The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order.
- Combinations such as 00 01 and 01 00 are considered the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1.
- You can only use the `putchar` function (other functions like `printf`, `puts` are forbidden).
- Limit the usage of `putchar` to a maximum of eight times in your code.
- Avoid using variables of type `char`.
- All code should be in the `main` function.
